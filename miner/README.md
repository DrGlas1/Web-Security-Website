## Miner

The miner is the server that contains the blockchain, it also creates the public/private key pairs for the wallets. 
The miner needs to be running to register a new user and to complete transactions. To setup the miner, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run miner.py
```
Use pip3 and python3 if that is what is installed on the system.
